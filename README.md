# Minimal To-do - A task manager with Kanban board for an AI world

The most lightweight, standalone Kanban board To-do app with separate Markdown storage. A single HTML-file for the User Interface, and a single Markdown file for storage. For a world where AI needs access to our task list more than we do.

## Quick Start

Start a local server to use the Kanban board. Here's how:

1. **Open a Terminal/Command Prompt** and navigate to the folder containing your files
2. **Run:** `python3 -m http.server 8000` in the folder containing your files
3. **Visit:** [http://localhost:8000/todo.html](http://localhost:8000/todo.html)

*Don't just double-click the HTML file - it won't work! You need to run a temporary server instance to use the todo.md file for storage.*

   # Alternative commands
   python -m http.server 8000          # If python3 doesn't work
   npx http-server -p 8000            # Node.js (note the -p 8000 flag)
   php -S localhost:8000              # PHP built-in server
   ```

2. **Open in browser**: Go to `http://localhost:8000/todo.html`

## Security

This app is designed for local use only on trusted devices. Since you're running this on your own machine with your own todo.md file, security is primarily about protecting your data integrity:

- **Local execution only**: Runs entirely in your browser, no external servers
- **File access**: Uses File System Access API to read/write your local files
- **Content trust**: Assumes your todo.md content is safe and trusted
- **No network calls**: Only loads external Google Fonts for typography
- **Browser security**: Relies on your browser's built-in security features

**Security considerations for local use:**
- Copy-pasting untrusted content into tasks could execute scripts
- File picker could accidentally access system directories
- Browser localStorage stores app state locally

For production or multi-user environments, additional security measures would be required.

## Contributing

**Seeking contributions!**

There's a lot of things that need to improve. It's nowhere near as user-friendly and feature-rich as the big commercial Kanban boards like Trello, ClickUp or Jira.

Your help is very welcome.

Areas for improvement:
- Enhanced task filtering and search
- Better mobile experience
- Additional task properties (due dates, assignees)
- Import/export functionality
- Better accessibility features
- Better browser compatibility

Limitation:
- vanilla JavaScript to avoid compilation
